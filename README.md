Welcome to the Garden Finance Testnet Assignment repository! This project demonstrates the integration of the Garden Finance SDK for performing BTC to WBTC swaps on the testnet.

## Overview

This repository contains a sample application that utilizes the Garden Finance SDK to facilitate BTC to WBTC swaps. The application is designed to interact with the testnet environment, allowing developers to test and verify swap functionality without using real assets.

## Features

- **Testnet Integration:** The application is configured to interact with the Garden Finance testnet, making it ideal for testing.
- **Swap Functionality:** Users can perform BTC to WBTC swaps through a simple web interface.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** The frontend allows users to input swap amounts and receive real-time feedback on transaction results.
